# record-app

The Vinylator: A MERN stack web app to manage your vinyl record collection, with statistics, charts, and a random record generator.

# Getting Started with The Vinylator

As of 2024, the Vinylator is available publicly at www.thevinylator.com.

To run the frontend locally, clone this repo and run the following commands:

'cd rrg-react'

'npm install'

'npm run start'

This may not work with all versions of Node. V14.0.0 should work, and can be set by running 'nvm use 14.0.0' before running the commands above.

The backend part of this app cannot be run locally without a .env file containing secrets known only to the developer.
However, when the React app runs locally, it will connect to a hosted Express & Mongo backend.
